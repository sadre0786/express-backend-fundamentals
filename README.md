# Express Backend Fundamentals

This repository contains hands-on practice
of core Express.js backend concepts.

## Topics Covered
1. Express request–response lifecycle
2. MVC vs Layered architecture
3. Enterprise-level project structure

## Purpose
To understand how backend systems work internally
and how scalable Express applications are structured.


### Middleware Design Patterns

- Global logging middleware
- Route-level authentication middleware
- Validation-style guard middleware


### Centralized Error Handling

Implemented a centralized error-handling middleware
using a custom error class to ensure consistent
and maintainable error responses.

### Validation & Sanitization

Implemented request validation and sanitization
using middleware to ensure data integrity
and prevent invalid requests.

### REST API Standards

Implemented RESTful user APIs using:
- Resource-based URLs
- Proper HTTP methods
- Correct status codes
- Consistent response structure

### API Versioning

Implemented URL-based API versioning (v1 and v2)
to support backward compatibility and safe evolution
of REST APIs.
